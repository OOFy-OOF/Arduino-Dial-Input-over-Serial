# Arduino-Dial-Input-over-Serial
Code for a simple scrolling input method using potentiometer and a few buttons. Given that Arduino UNO cannot communicate with PC as an HID device unless the user decides to flash custom firmware, I have decided to make an implementation based on reading serial output instead.
